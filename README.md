# ADC Simulator
This project is started with the intention of use of this simulator for teaching ADCs.

## Prerequisitie
This project is developed using Python 3.6 with following add ons
 - Python 3.6
 - numpy
 - matplotlib

## Running the program
$ python3.6 adc.py 4
* the last parameter is the number of bits

## Features
Following parameters can be changed
 - No. of bits
 - Sampling rate
 - Upper reference voltage
 - Lowe reference voltage
